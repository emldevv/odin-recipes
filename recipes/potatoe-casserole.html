    <h2>You know, that slight crunch followed by flavour...</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul></ul>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup diced yellow onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>4 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
            <li>8 ounces grated sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pound thinly sliced ham</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>MHeat butter in a pot over medium heat. Add onions and sauté with a pinch of salt until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add flour and cook, stirring, just to take off that starchy, raw edge, about 2 minutes. Pour in heavy cream and whisk to combine. Whisk in milk. Cook, stirring, over medium-high heat until it just starts to simmer and thicken up. Add 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and cayenne. Grate in nutmeg.</li>
            <li>Turn off heat. Stir in Worcestershire and fresh thyme leaves. Reserve until needed.</li>
            <li>Cover the bottom of a deep 10x15-inch casserole dish with about 25% of the reserved sauce. Add a layer of sliced potatoes, seasoning the tops with some of the remaining salt as desired; ladle over 1/3 of the sauce and sprinkle over 1/3 of the grated Cheddar cheese. Layer in ½ of the sliced ham.</li>
            <li>Place another layer of sliced potatoes on top and season with salt. Ladle over ½ of the remaining sauce; repeat layering with Cheddar cheese and ham.</li>
            <li>Place last layer of potatoes on top. Ladle over remaining sauce and spread out with a spatula. Sprinkle over remaining Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until browned, bubbling, and potatoes are very tender, about 1 ½ hours. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
